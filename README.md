# Discord Utility

This Discord Utility is a fun little project i'm actively wroking on for my own use, 
Just to have fun and annoy some friends, but shared it in case someone else wanted to have fun with it too or even wanted toexpand on it.

Features (for now):
- Spam
- Auto Reply
- Reply with a gif on specific keywords
- AI Chat bot (using chat-gpt)

If you decide to download the .exe also make sure to download the empty config.ini file and place it in the same folder.
